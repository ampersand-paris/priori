# PRIORI
A todo list for perfectionists with overwhelm. 

PRIORI is about prioritization. PRIORI is at its heart, a simple to-do list, that has been reimagined to keep perfectionists taking consistent and directed action towards their most important goals. The app's most unique feature is a limit of three assigned tasks to a single day of the week. No more procrastination from forever lists, only forever action.
