# PRIORI
A todo list for perfectionists with overwhelm

# USER STORIES
As a perfectionist:

I want to create a detailed and manageable to-do list.
I want to be able to add a description to my task. 
I want to be able to assign tasks to days of the week. 
I want to keep the number of tasks per day at a manageable number. 
I want to experience satisfation when a task is completed.
I want to experience my to do list in a sense of ease. 

Stretch:
I want to be able to organize my tasks by category tags. 
I want to be able to prioritize the single most important tast of the day.

All this, so that I might stay on task and keep from being overwelmed.
